# Speedrunners-Scoreboard


This project made for "Programming" class in my first year at college.

"Choose a problem from anywhere and make a solution for it" That is the thing requested from me.

Me and my friends were playing a game at that time and that game didn't have scoreboard system. So I chose this as a problem.

And I made the scoreboard system in C programming language with my C skills in 2018.
